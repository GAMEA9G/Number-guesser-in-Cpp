# Number Guesser game 
this is an easy game any one can play the Goal is simple you guess a number between 1 and 9 .
the code will ask questions if you answer it correctly the code will say the number in your mind
this may be complex than you might think it does not ask the number in your mind like other number guesser codes
(this is my first c++ code btw)

## Usage
run the main.cpp 

## Experience
i also made an html file to say my experience creating this
